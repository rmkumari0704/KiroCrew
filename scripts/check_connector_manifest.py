"""check_connector_manifest.py — validate connector-campaign manifest entries.

Enforces the field-level schema in
``docs/system-specs/modules/connector-capability-manifest.md`` against every
manifest entry, ``ConformanceRun``, and ``EvidenceReceipt`` record actually
committed to this repository. This is the W00-S2 validator: the spec itself
ships no runnable checker (deliberately — see that document's "What this
spec deliberately does not contain"), so this script is the first thing that
turns the spec's prose rules into a pass/fail gate a CI job can run.

## What this checks, structurally, per the spec

- Every manifest entry (one JSON file per operation, see the spec's
  "Resolved this round (W00-S2)" artifact-format paragraph) has the full
  required field set, correct types, and every required-when relationship
  the spec states (``pagination`` required iff ``operation_kind`` is
  ``list``/``search``; ``retry`` required iff ``effect`` is write-shaped;
  ``verification_contract`` non-null from ``code_complete`` on; the per-rung
  checklist; the three-way ``verification_contract`` <-> ``ConformanceRun``
  <-> ``EvidenceReceipt`` equality; the ``evidence_by_mode_surface_and_auth``
  totality rule once ``status`` leaves ``planned``; the per-cell four-
  coordinate equality against the run it cites).
- Every ``source.snapshot_ref`` resolves per the spec's now-fixed contract:
  an ``https://`` URL for ``official_docs``/``format_spec``, or an in-repo
  path that actually exists on disk for ``repo_path`` /
  ``search_snippet_corroborated`` / ``user_stated`` / ``not_yet_sourced``
  (except the ``not_yet_sourced`` placeholder itself, which is exempt by
  design — see the spec's own carve-out).
- Cross-file consistency: every ``ConformanceRun``/``EvidenceReceipt``
  reference a manifest entry makes actually resolves to a record that
  exists, and the referenced record's own back-pointers agree (the
  three-way equality above), never assumed from field presence alone.
- Denominator/count invariants the campaign's evidence catalog states
  (``services[].operations[]`` + ``gaps[].demoted_operations_full_record[]``
  + the one contract-attachment operation == 273; the 72 ``contract_id``
  total; the 247 ``required_acceptance_index`` entries) ARE cross-checked by
  this validator against ``catalog-evidence.json`` on every whole-tree scan,
  in ``_check_catalog_evidence_counts``. The check reads the counts from the
  file's OWN arrays/sub-counts and reconciles them against the ratchet
  constants ``_EXPECTED_TOTAL_OPS_WITH_ATTACHMENT`` (273),
  ``_EXPECTED_SHARED_CONTRACT_COUNT`` (72), and
  ``_EXPECTED_REQUIRED_ACCEPTANCE_INDEX`` (247); a count that fails to
  reconcile, or a missing/unreadable file, is a hard finding (fail-closed).
  Those three constants are the ratchet: any intended change to a denominator
  must edit the matching ``_EXPECTED_*`` here in the SAME commit, so the
  denominators cannot silently shrink. This makes mirroring the extract
  load-bearing rather than prose-only.

## What this deliberately does not check

- Liveness of an ``https://`` `snapshot_ref` (no network call — this is a
  static validator; see the spec's own "does not contain" list).
- Whether a `ConformanceRun`'s `verdict: pass` is actually TRUE (that is the
  conformance runner's job, a separate, not-yet-built round; this validator
  only checks that the schema's structural relationships hold given
  whatever verdict is recorded).
- Anything about the runner or discovery protocol's *implementation* — only
  the manifest-entry / `ConformanceRun` / `EvidenceReceipt` *schema*.

## Usage

    python3 scripts/check_connector_manifest.py          # validate every entry
    python3 scripts/check_connector_manifest.py --test   # self-test the rules
    python3 scripts/check_connector_manifest.py --entry docs/system-specs/connector-manifest/entries/github/gh_search_repositories.json
                                                  # validate one entry file

    'superseded runs are kept, never deleted'). The whole-tree scan only reads
    the tree at HEAD, so deleting a superseded run/receipt line together with
    its references leaves a self-consistent tree it passes — silently losing
    immutable audit evidence. Enforce append-only by comparing each evidence
    JSONL against the PR base: the base content's lines must be an exact PREFIX
    of the head content (only tail appends allowed); any changed, removed, or
    reordered line, or a deleted file, is rejected.

    SCOPE — read this exactly: the property enforced is BASE-RELATIVE and
    THIS-PR-ONLY. It proves the CURRENT change (base..head) removed or rewrote
    no committed evidence line/file. It does NOT prove the logs are append-only

    is invisible to a base-relative diff and is not caught here. A history-wide

    replaying every commit that touched these paths — none of which is in this
    slice. This gate is a per-PR ratchet, not a historical proof.

    removed' must list from base, never from head — a file absent at head is
    absent from a head-side listing and its deletion is invisible.
