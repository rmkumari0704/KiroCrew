"""GitHub request locator: turn an ``operation_id`` + typed params into ONE
concrete :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.production.HttpRequest`.

WHAT THIS OWNS
==============
W01's production transport (``control_plane/production.py``) is deliberately
vendor-blind: it composes custody + wire mechanics and INJECTS the step that
shapes an operation into a concrete method/URL/headers/body, because that shape
is the vendor owner's. This module is GitHub's implementation of that injected
:data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.production.RequestLocator` -- the
same role ``vendors/microsoft/graph/locator.py`` plays for Graph.

It is pure logic and it holds NO credential: the transport reveals the secret
into an ``Authorization`` header itself (``build_production_transport`` step 4),
so a locator that touched a token would be reaching across the one boundary the
production module drew. Every request this builds carries vendor headers WITHOUT
a credential, exactly as :class:`HttpRequest` documents.

HOW IT STAYS HONEST
===================
* **No string-concatenation of caller input into a path.** Every ``{owner}`` /
  ``{repo}`` / ``{issue_number}`` placeholder in a descriptor's ``endpoint`` is
  filled from a validated, individually URL-encoded segment (:func:`_segment`),
  and a path separator inside one segment is refused (:class:`GithubLocatorError`)
  -- the same guard ``graph/locator._require_id`` applies, so a caller cannot
  inject extra path structure through an id.
* **The operation is looked up, never guessed.** The endpoint template, HTTP
  method and pagination contract come from the existing
  :func:`~kiro_crew.connections.vendors.github.descriptors.get_descriptor` table
  (this slice OWNS no second copy of them); an unknown ``operation_id`` is
  refused rather than shaped into a fabricated URL.
* **The two pagination contracts stay disjoint.** A ``REST_PAGE`` operation
  renders ``page``/``perPage`` through :class:`RestPageRequest`; a
  ``CURSOR_AFTER`` operation renders ``after`` through :class:`CursorPageRequest`.
  This module never emits ``page`` for a cursor operation -- the exact
  contract-collapse ``pagination.py`` and the campaign evidence warn against.
* **A cursor page re-sends the provider's opaque continuation verbatim.** GitHub
  REST paging returns the whole next-page URL in the ``Link`` header, and the
  decoder surfaces that URL as the ``OperationResult`` cursor; when the executor
  hands it back as ``request_args["cursor"]`` this locator sends that ABSOLUTE
  url as-is rather than re-deriving query params, because the link already
  encodes the page position (the same "re-send the opaque link" rule Graph's
  paging layer documents).

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT OWN
===================================
No auth, no custody, no retry, no error classification, no transport. Those are
W01's, consumed. It also defines no vendor-error taxonomy: a shaping fault is a
:class:`GithubLocatorError` (a ``ValueError``); a vendor HTTP failure is W01's
typed boundary via ``classify_github_failure`` / the executor, never here.
