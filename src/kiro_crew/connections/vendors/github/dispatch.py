"""GitHub dispatch: drive a real GitHub operation through W01's executor.

WHAT THIS OWNS
==============
This is the piece that makes a GitHub operation ACTUALLY INVOKED -- located,
dispatched through W01's real executor and transport, decoded, and paged -- with
no naked sender anywhere. ``locator.py`` shapes the request and ``decoder.py``
reads the reply; this module is the caller that wires them into
:func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.execute` and
:class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.PageWalk`, over the
production transport composed by
:func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.production.build_production_transport`.

It consumes, and RE-IMPLEMENTS NOTHING, of W01's judgment chain:

* auth / handle trust / credential-mode permit / five-layer governance /
  write-replay all run inside ``execute`` -- this module supplies the inputs and
  never re-decides any of them;
* custody is W01's ``BindingSecretSelector`` + ``resolve_binding_secret``, bound
  per call to the trusted binding identity -- multi-binding therefore goes
  through W01's per-binding selector (e8), never a local substitute;
* the transport is W01's ``build_production_transport`` with GitHub's own
  ``locator`` / ``decoder`` injected -- the ONLY sender. Nothing here touches
  ``urllib`` / ``requests`` / ``httpx``.

The one GitHub-specific decision this module makes is which decoder a given
operation's pagination contract needs (:func:`decode_for`), and how to translate
a rich :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.vendors.github.descriptors.GithubOperationDescriptor`
into the five-field control-plane
:class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.operation.OperationDescriptor` the
executor dispatches by (:func:`control_plane_descriptor`).

SCHEMA VERSIONS THIS BUILDS AGAINST
===================================
Pinned so a shape change in the seam this consumes is a visible break:

* ``EXECUTOR_SCHEMA_VERSION == 4`` -- the executor envelope now exposes
  ``ExecutionOutcome.payload`` (the neutral data channel) beside the
  transport callable and paging surface this drives.
* ``PRODUCTION_SCHEMA_VERSION == 3`` -- ``build_production_transport`` takes a
  ``BindingSecretSelector`` (per-call custody) and threads the payload through.
* ``RESULT_SCHEMA_VERSION == 3`` -- ``OperationResult`` carries a single
  authoritative ``next_cursor`` plus the ``payload`` union
  (collection/object/bytes); the cursor lives ONLY on the envelope.
* ``OPERATION_SCHEMA_VERSION == 2`` -- the ``OperationDescriptor`` TypedDict shape.

:func:`assert_schema_versions` checks these at composition so a mismatch is a
loud failure, not a silently wrong decode.

WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT OWN
===================================
No auth, no custody, no retry, no fencing, no error classification, no
pagination engine -- all W01's. No credential ever reaches this module: it hands
the transport a ``vault`` (a ``SecretStore``) and a ``selector``; the secret is
resolved inside the transport, revealed once into a header there, and never seen
here. It opens no socket.
