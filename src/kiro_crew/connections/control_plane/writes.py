"""W01 · L07: the replay gate for a non-idempotent connector write.

A non-idempotent write (POST-creating a resource, sending a message) that is
issued and then leaves its caller with an UNCERTAIN outcome -- a timeout, a
dropped connection, a 5xx with no usable body -- is the dangerous case this
module exists for. Blindly retrying such a write can DO IT TWICE: two issues
created, two messages sent. The core invariant is:

    When a non-idempotent write's outcome is ``unknown``, a replay MUST be
    refused unless there is evidence the prior attempt did NOT take effect (or
    its recorded result can be reused).

This is pure decision logic over a recorded attempt, zero IO. It does not issue
the write, hold a client, or resolve a credential -- it decides, given what is
KNOWN about a prior attempt, whether replaying it now is allowed. The three
outcome states are deliberately distinct from both the success envelope
(:mod:`kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result`) and the RUN-01 error
taxonomy (:mod:`kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.errors`): those classify
what a call RETURNED, this records what is known about whether a call's effect
LANDED.

The three attempt outcomes
--------------------------
- ``succeeded`` -- the write is known to have taken effect. A replay would
  duplicate it, so the gate refuses to reissue and instead REUSES the recorded
  result (``reuse``). This is why an attempt record carries an optional
  ``recorded_result``: a known-succeeded write has a result to hand back rather
  than redo.
- ``failed_not_applied`` -- the write is known NOT to have taken effect (a
  provider rejection that never mutated state, a pre-flight failure). A replay
  is safe and ALLOWED: reissuing cannot duplicate an effect that never landed.
- ``unknown`` -- the write was issued and the outcome is uncertain. This is the
  case blind retry gets wrong. For a NON-idempotent operation the gate REFUSES
  the replay with a typed rejection, because reissuing might do the effect a
  second time and nothing here proves it didn't.

The idempotent-write exception
------------------------------
Whether an ``unknown`` outcome is safe to replay is decided ONLY by an explicit,
trusted idempotency assertion the caller places on the attempt record
(``idempotent=True``) -- a PUT-to-a-fixed-key upsert, a create carrying a
provider-honored idempotency token the caller vouches for. When set, an
``unknown`` replay is allowed; otherwise it is refused.

Idempotency is NEVER inferred from the descriptor's ``effect``. In particular
``effect=delete`` is NOT treated as idempotent: a second ``delete`` can land on
a resource that was RECREATED in the interim (deleting someone else's new
resource), and a given API's delete may itself not be idempotent -- so
``effect`` cannot stand in for a trusted idempotency guarantee. This keeps the
safe default (refuse) and makes the exception something a caller must explicitly
state, not something the gate guesses from an effect label.

Attribution: a record must belong to THIS request
--------------------------------------------------
An attempt record carries an identity -- ``operation_id`` plus an
``args_fingerprint`` and an ``idempotency_key`` -- and the gate CHECKS that
identity before honoring any outcome. A record whose ``operation_id`` differs
from the descriptor's, or whose fingerprint/key differ from the request's own,
is refused: another operation's record, or another argument set's recorded
result, is never a basis to allow a replay or reuse a result. The stored
fingerprint and key are compared, not merely retained.

    The gate over the core invariant. ``descriptor`` identifies the operation

    ``request_idempotency_key`` its own idempotency key. All three identity
    facets are checked FIRST -- a record that does not belong to this request is
    refused before any outcome is honored.

    Attribution (step 1) is UNCONDITIONAL and UNSKIPPABLE. Both identity inputs
    are REQUIRED keyword arguments, and the argument fingerprint is computed
    HERE from ``request_args`` rather than accepted pre-computed -- so there is
    no way to invoke the gate that gets ``allow`` or ``reuse`` without the
    argument comparison actually running. A record is refused (typed rejection,
    never allow/reuse) when any of these differ:

    - ``record["operation_id"]`` != ``descriptor["operation_id"]`` -- a record
      for another operation.
    - ``record["args_fingerprint"]`` != ``fingerprint(request_args)`` -- a
      record for another argument set. This is the residual hole the earlier
      optional-parameter shape left open: honoring a different argument set's
      recorded result is exactly the mis-attribution the gate exists to prevent,
      and it can no longer be silently skipped.
    - ``record["idempotency_key"]`` != ``request_idempotency_key`` -- a record
      for another key. The key is a REQUIRED argument (not optional): a caller
      that uses no key passes ``""`` explicitly, and the comparison still runs
      (a record carrying a key against a ``""`` request correctly refuses).
      Absence must be an explicit empty key, never an omitted parameter that
      silently disables the check.

    Then, for a record that belongs to this request:

    - ``failed_not_applied`` -> ``allow``: the prior write provably did not
      land, so a reissue cannot duplicate an effect.
    - ``succeeded`` WITH a recorded result -> ``reuse``: hand back the recorded
      result rather than reissue and duplicate it. ``succeeded`` with NO
      recorded result -> ``refuse``: there is nothing to reuse, and reusing an
      empty result would silently return nothing.
    - ``unknown`` -> ``refuse`` UNLESS the caller explicitly asserted
      idempotency on the record (``idempotent=True``). The outcome is uncertain
      and nothing proves the effect did not land, so a blind reissue risks doing
      it twice. Idempotency is decided ONLY by that explicit trusted assertion,
      never by the descriptor's ``effect``.
