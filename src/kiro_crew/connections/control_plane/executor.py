"""W01 · L09: the executor that wires the four control-plane judgments together.

L01..L08 delivered four decision primitives, but nothing yet CALLS them in the
one order a real dispatch must. This module is that caller. It is the seam every
provider stream (W02 GitHub, W05 Graph, ...) routes an operation through, and it
enforces -- BEFORE any transport call is emitted -- the full gate chain:

    1. trusted handle view   :func:`~...control_plane.handle.ensure_usable`
    2. credential-mode permit :func:`~...control_plane.auth_modes.permit_operation`
    3. governance intersection :func:`~...control_plane.policy.decide`
    4. write-replay gate       :func:`~...control_plane.writes.replay_decision`

Any one of these rejecting returns a typed :class:`OperationError` and the
transport is NEVER touched -- "emit first, decide after" would make all four
upstream slices dead code, so the order is load-bearing and tested by asserting
the fake transport's call count stays at zero on every deny path.

**Routing trusts the view, never the handle.** ``service_id`` and
``credential_mode`` are read ONLY off the :class:`TrustedHandleView` that
:func:`ensure_usable` returns from its issuance record -- never off the mutable
handle dict. Reading them off the handle would be the "validate then use the
unvalidated value" hole L08 exists to close; a test proves that mutating the
handle's ``service_id`` does not change where the executor routes.

Resolving the trusted view is not enough on its own, though: the CALLER also
hands in an ``offered_mode`` and a ``descriptor``, and both make claims about the
same two axes the view already decides. So before any permit decision runs, the
executor CROSS-CHECKS them against the view (:func:`_authorize` step 1b) and
refuses an ``auth`` error when either disagrees. Without that check a handle
issued for ``oauth_user`` / ``outlook`` would let a caller offer
``service_to_service`` (permitted purely because the descriptor happens to
declare both modes) or present a descriptor naming ``github`` -- validating one
value and then authorizing a different one, which is the same hole one layer up.

**Server clock, not the caller's word.** Time is derived from a SERVER-SIDE
clock, not from whatever instant the caller asserts: :func:`execute` and
:class:`PageWalk` take a ``clock`` callable (defaulting to :func:`time.time`) and
call it FRESH on every call and on every page, so expiry is re-judged against the
real current instant each time rather than once at the top of a walk. A finiteness
check stays in front of every time-sensitive judgment (:func:`ensure_usable`
refuses a ``NaN`` / ``inf`` clock and L08 turned a car over on exactly that), but
finiteness alone never made a caller-supplied instant trustworthy -- a PAST
timestamp is perfectly finite and would keep an expired handle alive for the
length of a paging walk. The explicit ``now`` argument survives ONLY as a
deterministic-test override; leave it unset and the clock decides.

**HTTP 412 is preserved, not flattened.** A precondition-failed response
(``If-Match`` / ``If-Unmodified-Since`` ETag mismatch) is NOT collapsed into a
generic ``conflict``: the executor returns a structured
:class:`PreconditionFailure` carrying the failed preconditions and the server's
current ETag, so the CALLER can decide to re-read and re-derive rather than blind
retry. It maps the write's recorded outcome to L07's ``failed_not_applied`` (the
write provably did not land), which is the branch ``replay_decision`` *allows* --
but "allowed to replay" is NOT "safe to replay as-is": a 412 tells you only that
the precondition you asserted is false, never the server's current state. The
correct shape is 412 -> preserve the structured signal -> readback + re-derive
the precondition -> only then retry. The executor deliberately does NOT
auto-reissue; it hands the structured signal back and stops.

When the transport reports NO failed precondition and no ETag, the executor does
NOT fabricate one: it reports ``preconditions == ()`` and sets
``condition_unknown`` (see :class:`PreconditionFailure`). Naming ``If-Match`` on
a response that never mentioned it would invent readback semantics that belong to
the vendor owner, and would tell the caller to re-derive a condition it may never
have asserted.

**A success carries DATA, not just a verdict.** The gate chain is the point of
this module, but a chain that authorizes perfectly and then returns nothing is
not a dispatch. So the 2xx envelope carries a
:data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.OperationPayload` -- a
collection of items, a single object, or raw bytes -- and
:attr:`ExecutionOutcome.payload` is where a consumer reads it. The executor does
not INTERPRET that payload: the injected
:data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.production.ResultDecode` produces it
(the neutral default carries the body's raw bytes verbatim; a vendor decode turns
them into items/object/cursor), and this module only carries it through unchanged.

**ONE cursor.** Pagination advances on
:attr:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.OperationResult.next_cursor`
and on nothing else -- :class:`PageWalk` reads it there, and the collection
payload does not carry a copy. A second copy is a second thing that can be wrong,
and a disagreement between them shows up as a walk that stops while pages remain
or refetches one it already has, neither of which is distinguishable from a
correct result at this seam.

**Response metadata is ALLOWLISTED.** The rate-limit family reaches a caller
through :attr:`ExecutionOutcome.metadata` (see :data:`ResponseMetadata`) and
through nothing else. A response header set is a credential surface --
``Set-Cookie`` mints a session, ``WWW-Authenticate`` carries challenge material --
so the transport copies only the names on a closed allowlist and drops the rest,
which is the response-side counterpart of the redirect credential strip.

**Boundaries.** Decision + dispatch glue. The transport is an injected callable
-- an in-memory fake in every unit test, and the REAL composition (vault-resolved
secret custody plus a stdlib HTTP client) in
:mod:`kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.production`, which is what makes this
an executor rather than a decision table. MS's own 412 / readback /
baseline / fresh / locator revalidation semantics live under
``vendors/microsoft/**`` and are that owner's -- this module only preserves the
shared structured signal MS consumes; it changes nothing there. It also does not
claim to cover document- / provider-level query ACL: L06's five-layer
intersection and the handle scope narrowing do NOT substitute for that
(a separately-owned gap), and this module makes no such claim.

#:
#: ``2`` added two shape changes that an old pin WOULD decode wrong, so both had
#: to bump it rather than ride along on ``1``:
#:
#: * :class:`TransportResponse` and :class:`ExecutionOutcome` grew
#:   ``write_outcome`` -- the transport's way of saying "the effect of this
#:   non-idempotent write is UNKNOWN", which a consumer must record instead of
#:   L07's ``failed_not_applied`` or it hands ``replay_decision`` a determinate
#:   answer the wire never gave and gets a DOUBLE WRITE waved through;
#: * :data:`Transport` now also receives ``trusted_view`` -- the
#:   :class:`TrustedHandleView` itself -- so a transport can bind its credential
#:   custody to the identity the call was actually authorized for instead of one
#:   fixed at composition time (see
#:   :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.production.BindingSecretSelector`).
#:
#: ``3``: the result envelope now carries DATA. :class:`OperationResult` grew a
#: required ``payload`` (see :data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.RESULT_SCHEMA_VERSION`
#: ``2``) and :class:`ExecutionOutcome` exposes it as :attr:`ExecutionOutcome.payload`.
#: An old pin would decode this wrong in the way that matters most: it would read
#: a success as carrying status + cursor and nothing else, which is exactly what
#: the whole success path used to be -- so a consumer written against ``2`` drops
#: every item, object and byte the operation returned rather than failing loudly.
#:
#: ``4`` is two more outer-shape changes:
#:
#: * :class:`TransportResponse` and :class:`ExecutionOutcome` grew ``metadata``
#:   -- the ONE allowlisted surface response metadata (the rate-limit family)
#:   reaches a caller through. A ``3`` pin has no field for it, so a caller that
#:   needs to back off keeps reading the header set it should never have been
#:   handed, or nothing at all;
#: * the result envelope's cursor is now SINGLE-SOURCED:
#:   ``CollectionPayload.next_cursor`` is gone and
#:   :data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.RESULT_SCHEMA_VERSION` is
#:   ``3``. A ``3``-era producer that set the cursor only on the collection now
#:   builds an envelope with ``next_cursor=None``, which stops a
#:   :class:`PageWalk` after page one and reports it as a complete result -- a
#:   silent drop, so the number has to move for it.

#: direction.

    The transport is the only thing that touches a network (a real HTTP client
    in production, an in-memory fake in tests). It returns this structured
    envelope rather than raising, so the executor classifies uniformly.

    ``http_status`` -- the HTTP status the provider returned (e.g. 200, 404,
    412, 429, 503). ``result`` -- the success envelope on a 2xx (with
    ``next_cursor`` for paging and the ``payload`` carrying the items / object /
    bytes the ``decode`` produced), else ``None``. ``preconditions`` -- the
    precondition names that failed on a 412 (``("If-Match",)`` etc.), empty
    otherwise. ``etag`` -- the server's CURRENT ETag on a 412 (what a readback
    would re-derive against), else ``None``. ``retry_after_seconds`` -- the
    server's advisory backoff on a 429/503, else ``None``. ``detail`` -- a short
    provider message; it is redacted by :func:`operation_error` before it ever
    leaves the executor.

    ``write_outcome`` -- what is now KNOWN about whether a non-idempotent
    write's effect landed, as one of L07's :data:`AttemptOutcome` values, or
    ``None`` when the transport makes no claim. It exists because the wire can
    fail in a way that answers NOTHING: a socket timeout or a connection dropped
    mid-flight means the request may have been received and applied, or may never
    have arrived, and the transport is the only layer positioned to tell that
    apart from a status the provider deliberately returned. Recording such a
    failure as ``failed_not_applied`` would hand
    :func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.writes.replay_decision` a
    determinate "it did not land" -- the one branch L07 ALLOWS replaying -- so a
    timeout would license a second ``sendMail``. A transport that cannot know
    says ``unknown`` here, and L07 then refuses to blind-replay unless the caller
    explicitly asserts the operation is idempotent.

    ``metadata`` -- the ALLOWLISTED response metadata (see
    :data:`ResponseMetadata`), lowercase-keyed and read-only. It is how the
    rate-limit family reaches a caller, and it is an allowlist precisely so that
    ``Set-Cookie`` / ``WWW-Authenticate`` / an echoed ``Authorization`` cannot: a
    response header set is a credential surface, and a transport that handed the

# --- pagination: real cursor advance, never a placeholder ---------------------
@dataclass
class PageWalk:
    """A real, terminating pagination walk over ``execute``.

    Each :meth:`next` call runs the FULL gate chain again (a cursor does not
    exempt a page from authorization) and emits one call carrying the current
    cursor. It advances on the response's ``next_cursor``, stops when that is
    ``None``, and refuses to loop forever on a repeated cursor -- so it neither
    drops nor duplicates a page and always terminates.

    **ONE cursor source.** That ``next_cursor`` is read from
    :attr:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.OperationResult.next_cursor`
    -- the envelope -- and from nowhere else. The collection payload does not
    carry a second copy to read instead (see
    :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.CollectionPayload`),
    because a walk with two candidate cursors has a losing branch that is
    invisible from here: reading the one that a middle layer did not update stops
    the walk early (records silently dropped) or repeats a page (records silently
    duplicated), and both look exactly like a correct walk to this class.

    **The walk holds a ``clock``, not an instant.** It stores no frozen ``now``:
    every page re-reads ``clock()`` and re-runs the gate chain against that fresh
    reading, so a handle that expires between page 2 and page 3 stops the walk at
    page 3. A cached instant would have made the whole walk -- however long -- run
    on the expiry judgment made at page 1, and finiteness checks cannot notice
    that, because a stale instant is a perfectly finite number. A deterministic
    test injects its own callable (e.g. one that advances on each call).

    **Every page carries the ORIGINAL request args.** ``base_args`` holds the
    filters/selectors the walk was opened with, and each page sends
    ``{**base_args, "cursor": cursor}``. Sending the cursor alone would silently
    drop the filter set from page 2 onward -- a different query than page 1 --
    and would change the request's ``args_fingerprint``, so L07's attribution
    would no longer recognize a retry of a page as the same logical request.

    ``done`` is True once the last page returned no ``next_cursor`` (or a gate
    denied / a transport error stopped the walk). ``pages`` counts the pages
    successfully fetched.
