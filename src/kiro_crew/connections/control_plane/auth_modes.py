"""W01 · L05: per-operation permitted credential modes + a deny-by-default check.

Where :mod:`kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.operation` fixes the closed
credential-mode vocabulary (Axis B) and carries the ONE mode a descriptor
authenticates with, this module answers the adjacent question a dispatch asks at
call time: **is the credential mode the caller offers permitted for THIS
operation?** :func:`permit_operation` is the ONE authorization decision, and it
consults BOTH the operation's descriptor (its declared ``credential_modes``) and
the governance policy -- there is deliberately no public policy-only sibling that
skips the descriptor, because a function named like an authz decision that did
not check the descriptor would be a bypass waiting to be used.

Descriptor declares, policy narrows (real enforcement, not a docstring)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The L01 :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.operation.OperationDescriptor`
carries ``credential_modes`` -- the SET of modes the operation supports at all,
aligned one-to-one with the manifest's per-operation ``auth_modes`` array. That
declared set is the OUTER BOUND: a governance policy (this module's
:data:`PermittedModes` / :data:`PermittedModeRegistry`) may only SUBTRACT from
it, never add. :func:`permit_operation` (and its registry sibling
:func:`permit_registered_operation`) enforce that in RUNNING CODE by deciding
against the EFFECTIVE set -- :func:`effective_permitted_modes`, the intersection
``policy ∩ descriptor["credential_modes"] ∩ CREDENTIAL_MODES``. So a mode the
descriptor did not declare is DENIED **even if the policy tried to permit it**,
and an UNKNOWN mode (outside the L01 closed set) is DENIED **even if the
descriptor and the policy both carry it** -- the closed-set floor, which is not
redundant because a ``TypedDict`` descriptor and a ``frozenset`` policy are
neither validated at runtime, so a bogus string can sit in both and a bare
``policy ∩ declared`` would keep it. This is deliberate: the seam's ``context.py``
says the selected mode must come "from within the descriptor's declared set",
but that sentence is a ``TypedDict`` docstring and a ``TypedDict`` validates
NOTHING at runtime -- the intersection here is the code that actually makes it
true, and the slice's counter-example tests prove the denials rather than the
wording. The bare policy-membership predicate is kept as the PRIVATE
:func:`_is_mode_permitted` (underscore, absent from ``__all__``) so it cannot be
mistaken for authorization.

Pinned to the L01 closed set, no new words
-------------------------------------------
Every mode this module names is one of the three L01
:data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.operation.CredentialMode` values
(``oauth_user`` / ``fine_grained_pat`` / ``service_to_service``), which are
themselves copied verbatim from the manifest's per-operation ``auth_modes``
array (``connector-capability-manifest.md``). This slice neither invents a
fourth value nor widens the closed set: a permitted-modes declaration is a
SUBSET of :data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.operation.CREDENTIAL_MODES`,
validated as such, and a declaration naming anything outside that set is
rejected as a programming error rather than silently honoured.

Deny-by-default
---------------
An operation that declares NO permitted mode is DENIED, never allowed. The
absence of a declaration is not an open door: :func:`permit_operation` treats an
empty permitted set (and an operation missing from a
:data:`PermittedModeRegistry`) as "nothing is permitted here", so a new
operation someone forgot to configure fails closed instead of accepting every
credential. A deny returns the L01 typed error built with
:func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.errors.operation_error` (RUN-01
class ``auth``), so the error text goes through the same unconditional
redact-then-truncate discipline every other error surface in this subsystem
uses -- this module opens no un-redacted error channel of its own.

Zero credential values
-----------------------
The whole API accepts and returns only **mode identifiers**
(:data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.operation.CredentialMode`) and
**reference strings** (an ``operation_id``). It never accepts, stores, or
returns a token, a client secret, a bearer, or any credential plaintext -- the
same "references, never a value" invariant the sibling
:mod:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.context` module carries. A permitted
mode says which KIND of credential is allowed; resolving a KIND to a live
credential is a later leaf in kiro-cli custody and is explicitly not here.

Two orthogonal axes, kept apart (the load-bearing invariant of this slice)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repo has two things spelled "auth mode"; they are different axes and this
module operates on exactly ONE of them:

- **Axis A -- registration mode** answers "where did the OAuth *client* come
  from": ``dcr`` (dynamic client registration) vs ``preregistered``. It lives in
  :class:`kiro_crew.connections.registry.AuthConfig`, is read through
  :func:`kiro_crew.connections.registry.auth_mode` /
  :func:`kiro_crew.connections.registry.is_preregistered`, and its values are
  :data:`kiro_crew.connections.registry.AUTH_MODE_DCR` /
  :data:`~kiro_crew.connections.registry.AUTH_MODE_PREREGISTERED`. **This module
  does not import it, restate it, redefine it, or change any of its APIs.**
- **Axis B -- credential mode** answers "what credential does *this operation*
  authenticate its call with": ``oauth_user`` / ``fine_grained_pat`` /
  ``service_to_service``. That is the L01 axis this module gates on.

The two value sets are DISJOINT (``{dcr, preregistered}`` vs
``{oauth_user, fine_grained_pat, service_to_service}``) and neither axis is
derivable from the other -- a ``preregistered`` client (Axis A) can still
authenticate an operation as ``oauth_user`` or ``service_to_service`` (Axis B).
Inferring a permitted credential mode from a registration mode would reintroduce
exactly the collapse the manifest's two-axis design ("an account type never
stands in for an auth mode") exists to prevent. L01 already set the precedent of
naming Axis B ``credential_mode`` on the descriptor to keep the axes apart in
code; this module keeps the same discipline and a companion test asserts the two
value sets do not intersect.
