"""W01 · L02: AUTH-01, the authorized-account binding record.

L01 (:mod:`kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.context`) fixed that every
per-call reference is a REFERENCE, never a value, and named the one an operation
is dispatched under: ``binding_ref``. This module is what a ``binding_ref``
points AT -- the record that says "this binding names a *verified* subject
acting within a *verified* tenant, authenticated by a credential whose reference
(never value) is recorded here". It is still pure types with zero IO: it MINTS
and INCREMENTS a record, it does not persist one, resolve one to a credential,
or reach kiro-cli.

Four load-bearing properties, each a distinct defence:

1. **The binding id is random, not derived.** :func:`create_binding` mints
   ``binding_id`` from :func:`secrets.token_hex` -- unguessable, and NOT a
   function of the provider slug, the tenant, or the subject. A derived id would
   let anyone who knew the (often public) slug/tenant reconstruct or enumerate
   binding ids, turning a reference meant to be capability-like into a guessable
   handle. The id carries no meaning: it is a name, resolved through a table a
   later leaf owns, never parsed.

2. **Only a VERIFIED subject and tenant are recorded.** A binding must not store
   whatever identity the caller *claimed*. :func:`create_binding` takes a
   :class:`SubjectTenantVerifier` and stores ONLY what it returns; if
   verification fails the verifier raises :class:`BindingVerificationError` and
   NO binding is built. There is no path from a caller-asserted subject/tenant
   to a stored one that skips the verifier -- the verifier is a required
   argument, not an optional hook.

3. **``generation`` is a monotonic counter, and only that here.** A fresh
   binding is minted at :data:`INITIAL_GENERATION`; :func:`next_generation`
   returns a NEW record with ``generation`` incremented by one and every other
   field carried through unchanged. Its PURPOSE is L04's revoke fencing -- a
   revoke will raise the generation so anything stamped with an older one is
   fenced off -- but **this slice lands the field and the increment SEMANTICS
   only. It does not implement refresh or revoke** (that is L04), and nothing
   here decides what a bumped generation invalidates.

4. **The secret is a REFERENCE and metadata, never a value.** A binding records
   a :class:`SecretRef` -- the vault entry NAME plus enough metadata (backend,
   the moment it was bound) to find and reason about the secret -- and it is a
   *hard invariant of the type* that no plaintext lives on it. The name follows
   the same ``CONNECTIONS_<SLUG>_...`` shape ``oauth_clients.client_secret_name``
   already uses for the Secrets panel, via :func:`binding_secret_ref`, so a
   binding's secret and a pre-registered client's secret read as the same family
   of vault entry rather than two naming schemes. Resolving that name to a
   :class:`~kiro_crew.secrets.SecretVault` / :class:`~kiro_crew.secrets.SecretValue`
   is a later leaf's job; this module only writes down WHERE the secret is.

The old-custody invariant, restated because it is the sharpest edge
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the pre-native custody model the OAuth token chain lives entirely inside
kiro-cli and the Kiro Crew backend only ``stat()``s to probe whether a grant
exists. **This module never reads, copies, or references an old kiro-cli OAuth
token.** A ``SecretRef`` names a NEW authorization grant's secret under a NEW
trusted owner -- it is not a place to smuggle a moved-over legacy token, and the
type deliberately carries only a vault-entry name, not a filesystem path into
kiro-cli's token store.
