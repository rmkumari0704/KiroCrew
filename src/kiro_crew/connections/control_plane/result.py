"""W01 · L01: the result envelope a connector operation returns.

A pure-type envelope, in the ``TypedDict`` + module-level schema-version shape
the connections subsystem already uses (``l0_probe.ProbeResult`` and
``l1_smoke.SmokeResult`` are the in-repo precedent). It does no IO: it describes
the OUTCOME of a call plus the DATA that call returned, so a downstream stream
and a runtime dispatch read one vocabulary for "did it fully succeed, partly
succeed, or is there more to fetch" -- and one vocabulary for "here is what came
back" -- instead of each inventing its own.

The envelope used to describe the outcome and NOTHING ELSE, which made the
success path functionally empty: a caller that got ``{"status": "ok",
"next_cursor": None}`` held no items, no object and no bytes, so every operation
in the plane succeeded at returning nothing. :data:`OperationPayload` closes
that. It is ONE neutral channel with exactly three preserved shapes -- a
COLLECTION (:class:`CollectionPayload`), a SINGLE OBJECT
(:class:`ObjectPayload`), and RAW BYTES (:class:`BytesPayload`, which is how an
Office document travels) -- because those are the three things a connector
operation actually returns and collapsing any of them into another loses data:
a collection flattened to an object loses every item but one, and bytes coerced
to text corrupt an ``xlsx`` irreversibly.

The ``status`` axis is two-valued and deliberately distinct from the
error taxonomy in :mod:`kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.errors`:

- ``ok`` -- the operation completed and returned everything it was asked for.
- ``partial`` -- the operation returned a usable-but-incomplete result. This is
  the SUCCESS-side ``partial``: some data came back and the caller may act on
  it. It is NOT the same concept as the RUN-01 error class ``partial`` in
  ``errors.py``, which classifies a FAILURE that partially applied; the two
  live on opposite sides of the success/failure line on purpose and a consumer
  must not fold them together.

Pagination is carried by ``next_cursor``: an OPAQUE continuation token when
more results remain, or ``None`` when the result is complete. It is deliberately
a single opaque string and never the vendor's raw locator shape -- one operation
uses ``@odata.nextLink``, another a ``page``/``perPage`` pair, another
``queryMore``; the manifest declares each operation's own ``pagination``
contract, and this envelope only needs to say "here is where you resume, or you
are done". A ``next_cursor`` is meaningful for both ``ok`` and ``partial``: a
fully-successful page can still have a successor, and the terminal page carries
``None``.

``OperationResult.next_cursor`` is the SINGLE AUTHORITATIVE cursor, and the ONLY
place a cursor lives. :class:`CollectionPayload` carries items and nothing else.

An earlier shape put the cursor on BOTH -- the envelope and the collection -- and
called it deliberate duplication, on the argument that a consumer handed only the
items would lose the continuation. That argument does not survive the failure it
creates. :class:`OperationResult` is a ``TypedDict``, so nothing stops a producer
from building one by hand, or a middle layer from editing ``next_cursor`` on the
mapping it was handed; the moment the two copies disagree a paging walk either
STOPS while pages remain (silently dropped records) or re-fetches a page it
already has (silently duplicated records), and neither is visible at the seam --
both look exactly like a correct result. One field cannot disagree with itself,
which is the only durable form of the guarantee, so the second copy is gone and
:class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.PageWalk` reads and advances
on ``OperationResult.next_cursor`` alone.

The consumer-hands-the-items-on concern is real and is answered by handing on the
ENVELOPE (or the ``(items, next_cursor)`` pair) rather than the bare payload: a
caller that drops the envelope has dropped the continuation on purpose, visibly,
in its own code -- as opposed to inheriting a truncation from two fields that
drifted somewhere upstream.
