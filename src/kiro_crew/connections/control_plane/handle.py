"""W01 · L08: a restricted, short-lived handle DERIVED from a trusted binding.

L02 (:mod:`kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.binding`) fixed the record a
``binding_ref`` points at: a :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.binding.Binding`
is a LONG-LIVED, FULL-AUTHORITY thing -- it names a verified subject/tenant and
references the connection's secret, and it never expires. Handing a call site
the whole binding hands it the connection's entire authority, forever. This
module derives a NARROWER, EXPIRING, NON-REVERSIBLE handle from a binding, so a
downstream consumer (W05's Microsoft Graph stream is the first) works under a
capability that is strictly less than the binding and cannot be turned back into
it. It MINTS a handle from a binding and it DECIDES whether a handle may be used;
it does not persist across processes, resolve one to a credential, revoke one,
or reach kiro-cli.

The trust model: a handle is a claim, the issuance record is the authority
====================================================================
A :class:`DerivedHandle` is an ordinary (mutable) ``TypedDict`` a caller holds
and passes around. It is therefore **not trusted**: a caller can edit its
``scopes``, push its ``not_after``, or change its ``generation`` in the dict. So
NO enforcement decision is ever read off the handle's own fields. Every mint
records the authoritative facts -- scope set, expiry, generation, binding
fingerprint -- in a module-private ISSUANCE REGISTRY keyed by the random
``handle_id`` (:data:`_ISSUED`), and :func:`ensure_usable` judges ONLY against
that record:

- it looks the handle up by ``handle_id``; a handle whose id is not in the
  registry is REFUSED (fail closed) -- this is exactly what makes an unknown,
  forged, cross-process, or post-restart handle unusable (see below);
- it decides expiry from the RECORD's ``not_after``, scope from the RECORD's
  scope set, generation from the RECORD's generation -- never the handle's
  self-reported copies;
- if the presented handle DISAGREES with the record on ANY axis a caller could
  abuse (a wider scope, a later expiry, a different generation, fingerprint,
  ``service_id`` or ``credential_mode``) it is REFUSED as tampered, rather than
  silently judged on the record and let through -- the mismatch is surfaced, not
  swallowed;
- it also REFUSES a non-finite ``now``: a ``NaN`` clock would make the expiry
  comparison silently False and let an expired handle through, so the enforcement
  never trusts the caller's clock without checking it is finite first;
- on success it RETURNS a :class:`TrustedHandleView` built from the RECORD (not
  the handle). **A consumer routes on this return value -- its ``service_id`` /
  ``credential_mode`` / ``scopes`` -- and MUST NOT read those off the mutable
  handle.** Returning ``None`` and leaving the caller to read the dict for
  routing would reopen the "validate, then use the unvalidated value" hole: a
  caller who flipped ``service_id`` to another provider would send the call
  there. The trusted view is the answer; the handle is only a claim.

Cross-process and restart semantics (a contract, fail-closed)
-------------------------------------------------------------
The issuance registry is PROCESS-LOCAL and IN-MEMORY: it starts empty at import
and is never persisted. Two consequences are guaranteed, not undefined:

- **After a restart, every handle minted before the restart is refused.** The
  new process starts with an empty registry, so no prior ``handle_id`` resolves,
  and :func:`ensure_usable` fails closed. A pre-restart handle is never silently
  accepted and never treated as valid.
- **A handle minted in another process is refused here.** Each process has its
  own registry, so a ``handle_id`` issued elsewhere is absent from this one and
  is refused identically.

This is the capability boundary: a derived handle is usable ONLY within the
process that issued it, for as long as that process lives and the record has not
expired. A handle is not a bearer token that survives serialization to another
process; that is deliberate, and it is enforced by the lookup, not documented as
a hope. (Cross-process handoff, if a later slice needs it, is a signed-record or
shared-store design that is explicitly out of this slice.)

The three invariants, each enforced by real code with a real refusal path
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Scope only narrows, never widens.** At mint, :func:`derive_handle` refuses
   a requested scope the binding does not grant (typed ``scope`` error, no
   handle minted). At use, :func:`ensure_usable` refuses a handle whose
   presented ``scopes`` are not a subset of the RECORD's scopes -- so a caller
   who widens the dict after minting is refused, not obeyed.
2. **An expired handle is refused.** :func:`ensure_usable` compares the presented
   ``now`` against the RECORD's ``not_after`` (inclusive) and refuses with a
   typed ``input`` error -- pushing the handle's own ``not_after`` changes
   nothing, because the decision reads the record. A non-finite or overflowing
   TTL is refused at mint (see :func:`derive_handle`), so ``not_after`` is always
   a finite, comparable instant.
3. **The handle cannot reconstruct the binding.** A handle carries NOTHING that
   rebuilds its binding: not ``binding_id``, not ``subject_ref`` / ``tenant_ref``,
   not the ``secret_ref``. Its ``handle_id`` is random. The one link back is
   ``binding_fingerprint`` -- a ONE-WAY keyed digest (HMAC-SHA256 under a
   per-process random key) of ``binding_id``, matchable by L04 revoke fencing but
   not invertible.

Why ``generation`` is carried but ``binding_id`` is not
-------------------------------------------------------
L04's revoke fencing (NOT implemented here) needs the handle's ``generation``
(to compare against the binding's current one) and a way to tell WHICH binding
the handle came from. Carrying the raw ``binding_id`` would answer the second
but break invariant 3, so the record and handle carry the non-invertible
``binding_fingerprint`` instead. This slice lands ``generation`` + the
fingerprint and proves they are preserved; it makes no revoke decision.

Secret custody is NOT this slice's
----------------------------------
This module handles REFERENCES and DERIVATION only. It never reads, copies, or
holds a secret value, and it does not touch the vault: the ``secrets/vault.py``
``SecretVault`` / ``SecretValue`` machinery and the
``oauth_clients.client_secret_name(slug)`` naming convention are the existing
custody mechanism, and a handle deliberately carries no ``secret_ref`` at all --
resolving a binding's secret stays a later leaf's job, gated by the handle's
scope and expiry rather than reachable from the handle itself.

Typed refusals reuse L01's :func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.errors.operation_error`
(which redacts its detail unconditionally); this module opens no error channel
of its own, exactly as ``policy.py`` / ``auth_modes.py`` / ``writes.py`` do.
