"""W01 · L09: the PRODUCTION transport composition for the executor.

:mod:`kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor` decides; it does not reach a
network. That is the right shape for the decision chain -- every gate is testable
against an in-memory fake, and the unit tests keep using that fake -- but a
dispatch seam that ONLY ever had a fake behind it is not an executor, it is a
decision table with an executor-shaped hole. This module fills the hole: it
composes a real :data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.Transport`
out of the two things a real call needs and a fake supplies neither of:

1. **Real secret custody.** The credential comes from the EXISTING vault --
   :class:`kiro_crew.secrets.SecretVault` (``secrets/vault.py``), the same
   AES-256-GCM store the Secrets panel and ``oauth_clients`` already use -- read
   by NAME through the :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.binding.SecretRef`
   L02 records on a binding (``binding_secret_ref`` builds the
   ``CONNECTIONS_<SLUG>_BINDING_SECRET`` name). No new vault, no new naming
   scheme, and no plaintext anywhere on the control plane's own types: the
   secret is resolved PER CALL, revealed once into an ``Authorization`` header,
   and never returned, stored on a closure, or placed in an error detail.
2. **A real HTTP client.** :func:`urllib_http_send` is the standard library's
   ``urllib.request`` -- the convention this repo already uses for outbound HTTP
   in non-async code (``apps/backend.py``, ``apps/official_catalog.py``,
   ``ops_mission_control/backend/providers/http.py``) -- so this adds no
   third-party dependency.

What this module deliberately does NOT do
-----------------------------------------
**No vendor semantics.** Turning an operation + its arguments into a concrete
method/URL/headers/body is the VENDOR owner's job (``vendors/microsoft/**``,
``vendors/github/**``): locator shape, ``@odata.nextLink`` vs ``page``/``perPage``
paging, readback and precondition derivation all differ per provider. So a
:data:`RequestLocator` is INJECTED, and the 2xx -> ``OperationResult`` decode is
injected too; the neutral default reports no continuation cursor rather than
guessing one provider's spelling, and hands the body on as RAW BYTES rather than
inventing a structure for it. This module owns custody + wire mechanics and
nothing above them.

**No network at import time.** Nothing here opens a socket, constructs a client,
or reads the vault while the module is being imported: every side effect happens
inside the transport closure, on a call. Importing this module is free.

**Not exercised by the executor's unit tests.** Those stay on the in-memory fake
(dependency injection is the correct design, not a workaround). The one test this
module owns proves the custody wiring -- that the transport asks the vault for the
binding's ``secret_ref`` name -- with an injected vault and an injected sender, so
it too performs no network.

**https only.** A ``Bearer`` credential over plain ``http`` is a credential sent
in clear, so :func:`urllib_http_send` refuses any scheme but ``https`` rather than
leaving it to the caller to remember.

**And https only PER HOP.** Checking the scheme of the URL a locator produced is
not the same as checking where the credential actually goes: ``urllib``'s default
opener FOLLOWS redirects, and its :class:`urllib.request.HTTPRedirectHandler`
copies every request header except ``Content-Length`` / ``Content-Type`` onto the
next hop -- so a provider (or anything that can answer as one) replying ``302
Location: http://elsewhere.invalid/`` receives the ``Authorization: Bearer``
header, at a different origin, in clear. That was observed on the wire, not
inferred. :func:`urllib_http_send` therefore installs its OWN opener with
:class:`_GuardedRedirectHandler` and follows NOTHING by default; when a caller
opts in with an explicit egress allowlist, every hop must independently be
``https``, be inside that allowlist, and -- for any hop leaving the original
origin -- travel with the credential headers REMOVED. See
:data:`DEFAULT_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` and :data:`DEFAULT_DEADLINE_SECONDS` for the
two other things an unbounded ``urlopen`` will happily do to you.

#: Bumped when this module's composition shape changes, mirroring the schema
#: version every sibling control-plane module carries.
#:
#: ``2``: :func:`build_production_transport` no longer takes a fixed
#: ``secret_ref``. It takes a :class:`BindingSecretSelector`, and the secret is
#: selected per call FROM the trusted binding identity the executor passes -- a
#: composition-signature change, so the number moves. :func:`urllib_http_send`
#: also grew the egress-guard parameters (``deadline_seconds``,
#: ``max_response_bytes``, ``allowed_redirect_hosts``, ``hop_log``); they are all
#: keyword-only with safe defaults, so an existing caller keeps working, but the
#: sender's observable behaviour on a redirect changed and that is a shape change
#: in every sense a downstream pin cares about.
#:
#: ``3``: the transport now populates
#: :attr:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.TransportResponse.metadata`
#: from :data:`RESPONSE_METADATA_ALLOWLIST` on every reply-bearing branch (2xx,
#: 412, other), and :func:`response_metadata` is a new public surface. A pin at
#: ``2`` sees no metadata at all, so a caller that should be reading
#: ``retry-after`` off the controlled surface goes looking for a header set this
#: composition deliberately does not hand out.
PRODUCTION_SCHEMA_VERSION = 3

#: Default per-socket-operation HTTP timeout. A transport with no timeout can hang
#: a dispatch forever, which is a worse failure than a typed ``temporary`` error.
#: This bounds ONE socket operation (connect, or one read) -- not the call.
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30.0

#: Default OVERALL wall-clock budget for one send: 60 seconds, from the moment
#: :func:`urllib_http_send` is entered until the body has been read.
#:
#: A per-operation timeout is not a bound on the call. A server that returns one
#: byte every 29 seconds satisfies a 30-second read timeout forever, and each
#: redirect hop gets its own fresh 30 seconds, so a redirect chain multiplies the
#: caller's expected wait by the number of hops. This is the number that actually
#: terminates the send, and the effective socket timeout is
#: ``min(timeout_seconds, time left on this deadline)`` so the deadline is always
#: the ceiling.
DEFAULT_DEADLINE_SECONDS = 60.0

#: Default cap on the response body this module will buffer: 8 MiB.
#:
#: ``response.read()`` with no argument reads until EOF into memory, so the size
#: of a control-plane process's heap becomes the remote end's choice. 8 MiB is
#: far above any control-plane JSON reply (a Graph page of messages is tens of
#: KiB) and far below anything that threatens a gateway; a body that exceeds it is
#: REFUSED with :class:`ResponseTooLargeError` rather than silently truncated,
#: because a truncated body handed to a vendor decode is the same silent-data-loss
#: shape that made a bare ``2xx -> complete ok`` wrong (see :func:`neutral_decode`).
DEFAULT_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES = 8 * 1024 * 1024

#: Read granularity while enforcing :data:`DEFAULT_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`. Small
#: enough that the cap is enforced before a huge body is resident, large enough
#: not to syscall per byte.
_BODY_CHUNK_BYTES = 64 * 1024

#: Headers that carry a credential and MUST NOT cross an origin boundary on a
#: redirect. Deliberately wider than the one header this module sets itself: a
#: vendor-owned locator may add its own key header, and the cost of stripping a
#: header a cross-origin hop did not need is nothing next to forwarding one it
#: should never have seen.
_CREDENTIAL_HEADERS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset(

#: The RESPONSE headers a caller may see, as a CLOSED ALLOWLIST.
#:
#: This is the only path a response header takes to a caller (through
#: :attr:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.ExecutionOutcome.metadata`).
#: Its shape is an allowlist and not a denylist because the two fail in opposite
#: directions: an allowlist drops a header nobody has thought about yet, and a
#: denylist forwards it. A response header set is a CREDENTIAL SURFACE --
#: ``Set-Cookie`` mints a session, ``WWW-Authenticate`` / ``Proxy-Authenticate``
#: carry challenge material, an echoed ``Authorization`` is the bearer token
#: itself -- and a caller serializes, logs and forwards what it is handed, so
#: forwarding the set wholesale is the response-side twin of forwarding a
#: credential across a redirect hop (:data:`_CREDENTIAL_HEADERS`).
#:
#: Every name is lowercase, which is also the key a caller reads it back under.
#: The two groups, and why each is here:
#:
#: * **the rate-limit family** -- the reason this surface exists at all. A caller
#:   that must back off needs the numbers, and there are three live spellings in
#:   the providers this plane serves (the RFC draft's ``ratelimit-*``, GitHub's
#:   ``x-ratelimit-*`` including ``used`` / ``resource``, and the older
#:   ``x-rate-limit-*``), plus ``retry-after``, which is the one every provider
#:   agrees on;
#: * **three benign descriptors** -- ``content-type`` (what the body claims to be,
#:   on a non-2xx where no payload carries it), ``etag`` and ``last-modified``
#:   (what a caller re-derives an ``If-Match`` / ``If-Unmodified-Since``
#:   precondition against on a readback, which is exactly the loop a structured
#:   412 asks for).
#:
#: Nothing here carries a credential, a cookie, a challenge or a principal, and
#: ``test_connections_control_plane_metadata`` pins that this set and
#: :data:`_CREDENTIAL_RESPONSE_HEADERS` stay disjoint so a later edit cannot add
#: one quietly.

    :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.OperationResult` carries
    ``status`` (in ``("ok", "partial")``), ``next_cursor`` and ``payload``. Two
    genuinely different 2xx replies can still land on the SAME ``status`` -- a 204
    that provably has no content, and a 200 whose body is present but whose
    continuation this module cannot know -- and the second must not be reported
    with the first's certainty. This wrapper is where that difference survives.

    ``result`` -- the L01 envelope to hand back (what the transport puts on a
    :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.TransportResponse`),
    including the :data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.OperationPayload`
    carrying the body. ``http_status`` -- the status it was read from.
    ``content_kind`` -- one of the four ``_CONTENT_*`` readings above. ``body`` --
    the raw bytes, PRESERVED. ``cursor_determined`` -- False when a vendor
    ``decode`` is required before any claim about completeness can be made; True
    when the status itself settled it.

    ``body`` and ``result["payload"].data`` hold the same bytes on the two
    body-bearing rows, and that redundancy is kept on purpose: ``body`` is this
    wrapper's own record of what came off the wire (a vendor ``decode`` replacing
    the payload with items must not erase it), while the payload is what a
    CONSUMER reads. They are written from the same ``reply.body`` in one place, so
    they cannot disagree.

    RESOLVED (this was a NAMED GAP): a caller that only saw ``result`` used to be
    unable to tell ``no_content`` from ``cursor_undetermined``, because
    ``OperationResult`` had no field expressing "content present, continuation
    unknown" -- and, worse, no field expressing the content at all. The envelope
    now carries a ``payload`` (``RESULT_SCHEMA_VERSION`` 2), so a ``no_content``
    row reads ``payload is None`` and a ``cursor_undetermined`` row reads a
    :class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.result.BytesPayload` holding the
    body. ``status`` is still downgraded to ``partial`` on the undetermined rows
    rather than asserting a completeness nobody established.

    * **an empty body** on a 200/201/202 is an acknowledgement; nothing came back,

    * **206** means the provider itself declared this a fragment, and L01 has the

      guessing a provider's cursor spelling (``@odata.nextLink`` vs ``page`` vs
      ``queryMore``) is the vendor owner's call and inventing one here would be
      wrong for every other provider -- but the ``status`` is ``partial``, not

      truncation than a missing cursor. A caller that needs items/objects/paging
      injects a ``decode``; ``cursor_determined=False`` is how it knows it must.

    The "no vendor cursor guessing" property is intact: no row READS the body. The
    payload carries it VERBATIM -- see :func:`_raw_payload` -- so nothing here

    Refuses any scheme but ``https``: the caller is about to attach a ``Bearer``
    credential, and sending that over ``http`` would put it on the wire in clear.

    **It does not use the default opener.** The default one follows redirects and
    copies the ``Authorization`` header onto every hop, so the initial https check
    guarantees nothing about where the credential ends up. This builds its own
    opener around :class:`_GuardedRedirectHandler`; with the default
    ``allowed_redirect_hosts=None`` NOTHING is followed and a 3xx surfaces as a
    status. Pass an allowlist to opt in, and each hop is then checked
    independently for https, membership, and -- off-origin -- credential removal.

    Three bounds, all keyword-only with the module defaults: ``timeout_seconds``
    caps ONE socket operation, ``deadline_seconds`` caps the WHOLE send (the
    effective socket timeout is the smaller of "what is left of the deadline" and
    ``timeout_seconds``, so the deadline is the ceiling even across a redirect
    chain), and ``max_response_bytes`` caps the body.

    ``hop_log`` collects a :class:`RedirectHop` per followed hop, which is how a
    caller (or a test) can assert that no credential crossed an origin instead of
    taking this docstring's word for it. ``monotonic`` is the deadline's clock,
    injectable for a deterministic test.

    A composer binds the non-default egress policy at composition:
    ``http_send=functools.partial(urllib_http_send,
    allowed_redirect_hosts=frozenset({"graph.microsoft.com"}))``. The

    """Compose the real transport the executor dispatches through in production.

    Returns a :data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.Transport`: it
    accepts the TRUSTED routing axes the executor passes (``service_id`` /
    ``credential_mode`` / ``trusted_view``, all off the handle view, never off the
    handle) and returns a :class:`TransportResponse`, so it drops straight into
    :func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.execute` in place of the
    unit tests' fake.

    Per call, IN THIS ORDER:

    1. ``selector`` matches the call's trusted binding identity and derives THIS
       binding's :class:`SecretRef`. A mismatch refuses here -- before the locator
       runs, before the vault is asked, before anything is emitted -- so a
       transport can never serve a call it does not hold custody for, and a
       refusal leaves no plaintext anywhere.
    2. ``locator`` shapes the vendor request (no credential in it).
    3. :func:`resolve_binding_secret` reads the credential FRESH from the vault.
    4. It is revealed once into an ``Authorization: Bearer`` header.
    5. ``http_send`` emits it; the reply is mapped to a :class:`TransportResponse`.

    A 412 carries back the preconditions this request asserted plus the server's
    ``ETag`` -- and NOTHING when it asserted none, which is what lets the executor
    set ``condition_unknown`` instead of inventing an ``If-Match``.

    **Response metadata is allowlisted, on every reply branch.** A reply that came
    from the provider (2xx, 412, or any other status) carries
    :func:`response_metadata` of its headers on
    :attr:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.TransportResponse.metadata`
    -- the rate-limit family plus three benign descriptors, and NOTHING else. The
    raw header set never leaves this closure. That matters most on the failure
    branch, which is the one a caller reads ``retry-after`` off, and it is also the
    branch where a provider is most likely to send ``WWW-Authenticate`` on a 401 or
    ``Set-Cookie`` on a redirect-ish 3xx; those are dropped because they are not on
    the allowlist, not because anything here recognized them.

    Nothing is cached: the secret is re-resolved every call, so a rotated or
    deleted secret takes effect immediately and no plaintext outlives the call.
    Failures are returned, never raised -- because the transport contract is a
    structured envelope. Details name only the status, the service and the
    operation: no response body, no header values, no credential.

    **An ambiguous failure is reported as ambiguous.** A connectivity failure used
    to become a flat 503, which the executor classifies ``temporary`` -- and a
    caller recording that as L07's ``failed_not_applied`` would be asserting the
    write did not land. It has no way to know that. A socket timeout, a dropped
    connection, our own overall deadline, a refused redirect (the first request
    WAS sent and answered) and a discarded oversize body (the server answered, we
    could not read it) all leave the effect genuinely undetermined. So for an
    effect :func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.is_non_idempotent_effect`
    calls non-idempotent, every one of those sets ``write_outcome`` to
    :data:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.writes.ATTEMPT_UNKNOWN`, and L07
    then refuses to blind-replay unless the caller explicitly asserts idempotence.
    The asymmetry is deliberate: a wrong ``unknown`` costs a refused replay the
    caller can override, a wrong ``failed_not_applied`` costs a duplicated
    ``sendMail``. Determinate-and-nothing-sent is kept determinate -- the
    non-https refusal and the binding mismatch both happen before a socket exists,
    so neither sets an outcome. :data:`_AMBIGUOUS_TRANSIT_STATUSES` (502/503/504)
    is treated the same way: a gateway failure is a failure in transit, so no
    end-to-end verdict was reached.

    NAMED GAPS (not fixed here, and not claimed as working):

    * **principal -> binding.** A :class:`BindingSecretSelector` is composed for
      ONE binding and refuses every other. There is no trusted resolver in this
      stack from a caller/principal to the binding it may act through, so one
      transport cannot serve many tenants -- a caller composes one per binding.
      This is a REFUSAL, not multi-identity support: nothing here should be read
      as "real multi-identity runtime complete".
    * **L03 (auth-code / PKCE).** The credential the vault holds has to have been
      put there by an authorization flow this stack does not implement. This module
      reads custody; it never establishes it.
    * **L04 (refresh rotation, revoke fencing).** The selector matches a binding
      fingerprint but judges NOTHING about ``generation``: a handle from a revoked
      or superseded generation still matches its binding here. Fencing is L04's,
      and until it lands a rotated-out generation is not stopped by this module.
    * **HTTP 500.** Left OUT of :data:`_AMBIGUOUS_TRANSIT_STATUSES` on purpose:
      whether a given provider's 500 is raised before or after it commits is
      provider knowledge, so a vendor owner that knows its API commits first must
      set ``write_outcome`` itself. Treating every 500 as ``unknown`` here would
      make almost every write unreplayable on a provider that 500s pre-commit.
