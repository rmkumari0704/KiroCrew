"""GitHub structured-source connector.

GitHub's issues, pull requests, commits and check-runs are not prose: each is a
record with a stable identity and typed fields. This connector turns those
records into the knowledge Library's existing row shape so they are searchable
and refreshable like any other source, WITHOUT a second knowledge base, registry
or sync engine — it is a :class:`BaseConnector`, driven by the same
``SyncScheduler`` as ``local_folder``.

What it owns, and what it borrows:

* **Owns** the domain model — the typed rows below, the primary keys that make a
  refresh idempotent, the conversion from a GitHub API payload into a row, the
  ``since`` + primary-key-diff that makes a refresh incremental, and the
  resumable checkpoint that lets a refresh interrupted mid-run continue instead
  of restarting.
* **Borrows** everything else. The checkpoint lives in the source's existing
  ``properties`` blob (the same per-source state the scheduler already reads for
  ``last_synced`` / ``consecutive_failures``); no new table is added. Ingestion,
  de-duplication, storage and per-row lineage recording stay in the pipeline the
  scheduler already calls.

**Live fetch is not wired here.** Reaching GitHub needs the real transport
executor from the connections stack, which is not on ``main`` yet, and
multi-page extraction consumes ``connections.vendors.github`` pagination once
that lands rather than growing a second copy of paging here. Until then
:meth:`fetch` refuses rather than returning a partial or mocked dataset: a mock
is not a live read and must never be presented as one. Everything else — the
typed rows, the keys, the conversion, the incremental diff, the checkpoint and
the per-row lineage — is exercised on ``main`` today by the pure functions this
module exposes and their tests.

    it. The typed-row conversion, primary-key diffing and checkpointing are the
    module-level pure functions above; this class binds them to the connector
    contract and owns config validation.

    refuse until the live executor is wired, because a mock read is not a
    live read; the pure conversion/diff/checkpoint surface is what is verified on
