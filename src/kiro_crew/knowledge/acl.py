"""Query-time access control for the shared Knowledge Library.

The retriever's ``source_id``/``namespace`` filters are relevance labels, NOT a
security boundary (their own docstrings say so, and the graph leg ignores them
entirely). A knowledge base that ingests *shared* sources under an admin/service
identity must therefore gate what any given querying user actually sees at
RETRIEVAL time against that user's OWN permission -- never the ingestion
identity's, never a filter the caller could widen, and never a permission
snapshot taken at ingest time (see KB-01/ACL-05/ACL-09 in the connector
production stack's shared contracts).

Two design corrections drive this module, both from Root's re-read of an earlier
version that got them wrong:

1. THE BYPASS IS ITEM-SCOPED, NOT CALL-SURFACE-SCOPED. One ``KnowledgeStore``
   mixes trusted-local material (a personal folder, an Obsidian vault, pasted
   documents) with MANAGED cloud/structured items (SharePoint, OneDrive,
   Salesforce, a structured GitHub source). A path being *named* "personal
   dashboard" does not prove every candidate it retrieves is un-ACL'd local
   material. So a caller with no cross-identity boundary (the local single-user
   library) may see trusted-local items WITHOUT a grant, but a managed item is
   ALWAYS gated against a real current subject/tenant -- and when that caller
   carries no verifiable identity to check it against, the managed item is
   DENIED (that item, not the whole library). :class:`is_managed_source_type`
   draws the line; :class:`SubjectTenantAclPolicy` enforces it per item.

2. A STATIC INGEST-TIME GRANT IS NOT PROOF THE PROVIDER STILL GRANTS ACCESS. The
   ingest-written ``subjects`` snapshot and a locally-bumped ``acl_version``
   cannot, on their own, observe a revocation the provider made after ingest.
   Real query-time ACL therefore requires a REVALIDATION chain: a managed item's
   grant must be confirmed current within a staleness window by a trusted
   :class:`RevalidationHook` (the provider live-permission interface). That hook
   is a named DEPENDENCY, not yet implemented here; until it is wired, a managed
   item's grant is treated as UNVERIFIABLE and DENIED (fail-closed). A static
   grant that is never refreshed must never masquerade as a live check.

This module owns the DECISION over grant records the store holds; it performs no
provider I/O itself. The revalidation hook, when supplied, is where that I/O
lives.

    trusted-local" is NOT a shared-query authorization rule, because the test
    habit of omitting a source is not production trust evidence, and an item
    whose provenance cannot be verified must not be waved through.

    * a source stamped :data:`TRUST_LOCAL` -> trusted-local (the ONLY local case);
    * a ``managed`` stamp, an unstamped/unknown/``None`` stamp (a legacy source

      gone) -> managed;
    * a SOURCELESS item (``has_source`` False) -> MANAGED. Absence of a source is
      not proof of no external ACL. Production ingestion always attaches a

      creator (folder/file/vault/artifact/agent); a sourceless row is
      unverifiable provenance and is denied to a shared query. The single-user

      sourced+stamped; only records with NO provenance evidence at all are
      locked out (which, if any exist in a real library, are reported for
      explicit migration -- never auto-backfilled to local).

    The decision reads the stored provenance stamp only; it never re-guesses
    trust from a source_type string, so a new/misspelled cloud connector type,
    or a managed source missing its per-item flag, cannot be waved through as
    local. The stamp itself does not prove the issuer is trusted -- only a
    trusted local creator may issue :data:`TRUST_LOCAL` (see
