"""Dashboard knowledge-search ACL wiring seam.

The dashboard handler resolves the query-time AccessContext from the request and
pulls an optional RevalidationHook off the app, so a shared/multi-tenant
deployment can plug in the provider identity resolver + revalidation hook
without touching the call sites. These tests exercise those two seams directly.
