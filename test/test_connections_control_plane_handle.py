"""Contract, fault, and negative tests for the W01 · L08 derived handle.

The handle is a caller-held CLAIM; the issuance record is the authority. These
tests check the three invariants the slice exists to enforce, each with a REAL
refusal from REAL code (never a docstring): (1) scope only narrows -- both at
mint AND at use, so a caller who widens the handle dict is refused; (2) an
expired handle is refused, decided from the trusted record, and a non-finite TTL
is refused at mint; (3) the handle carries nothing that reconstructs the
binding. They also pin the cross-process / restart contract (fail closed) and
that the new symbols are canonical to ``control_plane`` and NOT top-level
aliases.
