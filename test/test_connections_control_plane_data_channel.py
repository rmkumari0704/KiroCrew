"""W01 · L09: a CONSUMER really receives the data, through the real composition.

The gap this pins was fatal and silent: every judgment in the plane was strict,
every gate was tested, and the SUCCESS path returned nothing. ``OperationResult``
was ``{status, next_cursor}``, ``neutral_decode`` threw the body away, so a caller
that authorized, routed and emitted a call correctly held a verdict and no items,
no object and no bytes. Reproduced before the fix with ``/tmp/l09c-prefix-probe.py``.

**What "proven" means here.** Not ``body is not None``. Each test below builds the
REAL production transport (:func:`build_production_transport`) over a REAL
isolated on-disk :class:`kiro_crew.secrets.SecretVault` and drives it through
:func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.execute` /
:class:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.executor.PageWalk`, then asserts the
VALUES a consumer holds: the item fields, the cursor string, and -- for an Office
download -- the bytes, byte for byte. A test that asserted presence rather than
content would pass just as happily on a payload carrying the wrong bytes, which is
the failure mode that makes a binary channel worthless.

The sender is injected (``http_send`` ) here rather than a loopback TLS server:
this is the FAST UNIT LANE for the data channel -- what the decode produces and
what survives to the consumer -- and it stays that way deliberately. It is NOT
the evidence that a payload travels a real sender: an injected callable cannot
prove that, and
``test_connections_control_plane_real_tls_e2e.py`` is where all three shapes are
proven end to end over a REAL TLS loopback through the unmodified
:func:`~kiro_crew.connections.control_plane.production.urllib_http_send`, in a
fresh-install posture, with a readback against the exact bytes the server served.
The wire properties themselves -- redirects, credential stripping, the body cap,
the deadline -- are proven against real sockets in
``test_connections_control_plane_production.py``.
